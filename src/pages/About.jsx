        <p>
          Hi, I'm Avni Salhotra â€” a builder, engineer, and creative thinker.
          I thrive at the intersection of code and design, crafting projects that blend technical precision with human-centered experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site started as a simple resume hub but grew into a playground for interactive design and experimentation.
          I believe in learning through building, staying curious, and pushing my own boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking with my dog Echo, exploring new technologies, or working toward my next personal milestone.
