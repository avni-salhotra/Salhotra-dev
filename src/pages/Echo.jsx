          Hi! I'm Echo, a golden retriever with a big heart and an even bigger love for adventures.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          I spend my days hiking through trails, swimming in lakes, and napping by the desk while my human builds cool projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          When I'm not busy being adorable, I'm reminding everyone that a little joy, persistence, and playfulness can brighten any day.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Thanks for visiting our little corner of the internet â€” hope to see you on a trail someday!
